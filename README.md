Managing a library involves tracking numerous details, including who is borrowing which books, when they are due, and who is responsible for the library's daily operations. 
Traditional paper-based systems or simple spreadsheets can be error-prone and cumbersome. 
Our Library Management System addresses these issues by providing a centralized digital platform for managing library operations.

The Library Management System is designed to help library staff manage various aspects of library operations efficiently. 
This system provides the following key functionalities:

    Member Management: Add, update, and view library members.
    Employee Management: Add, update, and view library employees.
    Book Management: Add, update, and view books in the library's collection.
    Checkout Management: Check out and return books, with automated due date tracking.
